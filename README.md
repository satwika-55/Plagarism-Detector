# Plagiarism Detector

## 📌 Overview
This is a Python-based plagiarism detector that compares two text files and calculates the percentage of plagiarized content. It uses text similarity techniques to identify common phrases and sentences between the two documents.

## 🚀 Features
- Compares two text files
- Calculates plagiarism percentage
- Highlights similar content
- Simple and easy to use

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plagiarism-detector.git
   cd plagiarism-detector
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🔧 Usage
Run the script by providing two text files as input:
```sh
python plagiarism_detector.py file1.txt file2.txt
```
Example Output:
```
Plagiarism Detected: 72.5%
```

## 📝 How It Works
1. Reads both text files.
2. Cleans and preprocesses the text (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, etc.).
3. Uses similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Jaccard index, or Levenshtein distance) to compare the content.
4. Outputs the plagiarism percentage.
